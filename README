QJS is a simple JavaScript framework designed for simplicity and speed.
It is currently an active work in progress.

All functions are fairly well tested.  Tests can be run by simply opening the runner.html for the particular
library you would like to test, or by opening all.html to test all libraries.  

To use:

Include global.js first, then include any additional stuff you would like to use.

I'll release fully-assembled builds when I get more useful features into the library.
